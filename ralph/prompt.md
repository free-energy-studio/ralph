# Ralph Agent Instructions

## Your Task

1. Read `ralph/prd.json`
2. Read `ralph/progress.txt` if it exists, otherwise create it with a "## Codebase Patterns" header
3. Checkout to the branch specified in `branchName` (create it if it doesn't exist)
4. Pick highest priority story where `passes: false`
5. Implement that ONE story
6. Run typecheck and tests
7. Update AGENTS.md files with learnings
8. Commit: `feat: [ID] - [Title]`
9. Update prd.json: `passes: true`
10. Append learnings to progress.txt

## Progress Format

APPEND to progress.txt:

```
## [Date] - [Story ID]
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered
  - Gotchas encountered
---
```

## Codebase Patterns

Add reusable patterns to the TOP of progress.txt:

```
## Codebase Patterns
- Migrations: Use IF NOT EXISTS
- React: useRef<Timeout | null>(null)
```

## Stop Condition

If ALL stories pass, reply:

```
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

Otherwise end normally.
